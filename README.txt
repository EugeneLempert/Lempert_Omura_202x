Greetings curious one.

This repository is for a manuscript that is still in development.

The specific work is the RT-qPCR results, Bulk RNASeq results, scRNASeq results, and cAMP Assay results.

R file for the RT results
R file for the Bulk RNASeq
R file for the scRNASeq 
R file for the cAMP assays

I do not know the licensing agreements of the future publisher as of this time, but I will update as I learn more.  

The information surrounding these analysis files, how they reached their current state, and my rationale up to that point- I can make available through direct communication.

Feel free to contact me at genielamp16@gmail.com to comment, question, or criticize my work.
